## Course Description

CS536 is a graduate-level course in Computer Networks at Purdue University. In this course, we will explore the underlying principles and design decisions that have enabled the Internet to (inter)connect billions of people and trillions of things on and off this planet---especially under the current circumstances marred by COVID-19. We will study the pros and cons of the current Internet design, ranging from classical problems (e.g., packet switching, routing, naming, transport, and congestion control) to emerging and future trends, like data centers, software-defined networking (SDN), programmable data planes, and clound computing to name a few.

The goals for this course are:

- To become familiar with the classical and emerging problems in networking and their solutions.
- To learn what's the state-of-the-art in networking research: network architecture, protocols, and systems.
- To gain practice in reading research papers and critically understanding others' research.
- To gain experience with network programming using state-of-the-art research platforms.

## Programming Assignments

- [Assignment 0](assignments/assignment0): Virtual networks using Mininet and ONOS `not graded`
- [Assignment 1](assignments/assignment1): File and Message Transmission using Sockets and 3-Way Handshake `due Oct 07`
- [Assignment 2](assignments/assignment2): From Bridging to Switching with VLANs `due Nov 04`

## Paper Reading and Discussion

Starting Week 3, we will be reading and discussing **six** research papers on topics ranging from network protocols, systems, and architectures. The class will take place on Thursdays, and we will be discussing one paper every other week -- so we can discuss them in-depth. You should closely read each paper and add comments and questions along with a 1-page summary of the paper on [Perusall](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2022-cs-53600-le1-lec/_/dashboard) by the due date below. Please plan to provide at least five comments or questions for each paper on Perusall ahead of the associated class and follow the comments from other students and the course staff. Please come to class prepared with several points that will substantially contribute to the group discussion. 

> **Note:** General tips on reading papers are [here](https://gitlab.com/purdue-cs536/fall-2022/public/-/raw/main/readings/HowToRead2017.pdf). 

Grades for your class participation and paper reviews will be determined based on attendance and, more importantly, substantial contributions to paper discussions both on Perusall and in class.

> **Note:** 
> - What we expect you to know and prepare before each discussion is [here](readings).
> - Submit paper summaries via [Perusall Notes](https://app.perusall.com/courses/fall-2022-cs-53600-le1-lec/_/notes) and share it with your respective PSO TA and the Professor.

## Course Project

> See a list of past projects [here](https://gitlab.com/purdue-cs536/spring-2021/public/-/tree/master/projects).

The course includes a semester-long systems-building project that should be done in groups (either of size 5 or six, to be determined by the instructor after the course size is finalized) and must involve some programming. All group students are expected to share equally in the implementation. Students are expected to:

1. Reimplement or reproduce results from a paper we read during the semester or on a similar topic OR
2. Implement novel research projects, but such projects must be closely related to the material and topics covered in the course

> **Note:** If you are uncertain about the project's satisfiability, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.

### Project proposal
There are two types of projects in this class: reproducing others' research results and novel research. Proposals should be submitted via [HotCRP](https://purdue-cs536-fall22.hotcrp.com/).

#### a. Reproducing research
For reproducing research projects, students should include the following information in their proposal.

- **Background**
  - Name of the paper
  - A brief summary of the paper's problem domain/challenge, goals, and technical approach
  - Summary of paper's current implementation, evaluation strategy, and key results
- **Plan**
  - Proposed implementation (language, framework, etc.)
  - Evaluation strategy (testing platform/setup, simulated data/traces, etc.)
  - Key results trying to reproduce
  - Discussion of how you can compare your findings (quantitatively, qualitatively) with previously published results
  - New questions/settings trying to evaluate that are not addressed in the original paper
  - As the final plan mentions, it is important when reading a paper to ask what questions and/or settings are not included in an evaluation. For example, what happens if a workload shifts from being uniformly distributed to Zipfian? What if failures occur differently than evaluated? What if the data in a big data processing system has a different structure than evaluated (e.g., the "graph" that the data represents has a different edge distribution)? And so forth ...

#### b. Novel research
For novel research projects, students should include the following information.

- **Background**
  - What problem is research attempting to solve?
  - Why is the problem important?
  - How does this relate directly to topics or papers covered in class
- **Novelty**
  - What is the current state-of-the-art in related work, and why are they insufficient?
  - What is your (novel) technical insight/approach to solving this problem
- **Plan**
  - Proposed implementation (language, framework, etc.)
  - Key questions that evaluation will address
  - Evaluation strategy (testing platform/setup, simulated data/traces, etc.)
  - What does "success" look like? How do you quantify/compare results to alternative approaches / related work?

> **Note:** If students are concerned that their proposed project might not be sufficiently relevant to CS 536 to satisfy the topical criteria, please contact instructors earlier than later. Proposals not closely related to the topical matter may be rejected outright as inappropriate.

### Project selection
The project proposal from above will be finalized. This may involve some back-and-forth between instructors and the group (likely via [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G7E058110/feed)).

### Final report
The final report will be in the form of a paper written in Latex and submitted as a PDF file via [HotCRP](https://purdue-cs536-fall22.hotcrp.com/).

> **Notes:** 
> - For reproducible projects, the report should have a particular focus and discussion on the evaluation (setup, comparative results, discussion of differences, and so forth).
> - The project writeup should be six pages of double-column, single-spaced, 10-point font (excluding references, which can go on extra pages), similar in spirit to a workshop paper. Papers must be typeset in LaTeX using the [ACM `sigconf` template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvnghjbzwpc).

### Deliverables

- Team selection `due Sep 11`
- Project proposal `due Oct 04`
- Project report/presentation `TBD`
